# Aloja – PHP, MySQL, and jQuery-Based Hosting Platform

**Aloja** is a simple web platform developed using PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript (with jQuery and Bootstrap) that represents a non-conventional lodging company. Unlike traditional booking systems, Aloja is built around the concept of *stays* rather than *reservations*.

## 🌐 Overview

This project serves as the front-facing site for Aloja, where potential clients can view the company's available services and how to get in touch — without making bookings directly through the platform. It functions more as an informational and contact-driven site rather than a transactional one.

## 📁 Features

- Flat and minimal file structure — no complex framework.
- Backend built with plain PHP and MySQL.
- Frontend enhanced with JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
- Only basic security practices applied.
- Designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy.
- Focused on showcasing services and contact options for potential customers.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **No client-side reservations or bookings.**
- **No advanced security layers** — this project is a basic prototype and should not be used as-is in production environments.
- Lacks features such as user authentication, input validation, or administrative dashboards.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: PHP (Vanilla)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS
  - JavaScript (with jQuery)
  - Bootstrap for responsive design

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is meant to showcase a simple prototype of the Aloja lodging concept and may serve as a base for future feature-rich or secure implementations.
